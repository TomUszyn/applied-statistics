    "#### 1. What is Standard Deviation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard deviation (SD)** measures how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean.  \n",
    "- A **low SD** means values are close to the mean.  \n",
    "- A **high SD** means values are more spread out.  \n",
    "Population SD is denoted by **σ**, and sample SD by **s**.  \n",
    "For more information, visit the [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) page on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Population vs. Sample Standard Deviation\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Dividing by **n − 1** corrects for bias introduced by estimating the population mean from the sample mean.  \n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this simulation is to examine how the **Type II error rate (β)** changes as the difference between the two population means increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [Detailed Explanation of Type II Error | Sapien's AI Glossary](https://www.sapien.io/glossary/definition/type-2-error), a **Type II error** occurs when a statistical test concludes in favour of the null hypothesis even though the null hypothesis is actually false. In this case, the researcher assumes data come from **two independent normal distributions**, conducts **t-tests**, and records how often the test fails to reject the null hypothesis."

    "### Research and Development Context\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of **Type II errors**, the study considers several factors that influence the **statistical \n",
    "power** of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**: Increasing the sample size lowers variability, hence allowing detection of true differences by the test.\n",
    "A more complete description of this relationship can be shown on the Wikipedia page for [Statistical Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level of Significance (α):** A decrease in the level of significance α reduces the probability of Type I error but increases that of Type II. Similarly, an increased α decreases β.\n",
    "For more information, see the section entitled [Significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance#Significance_level) in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Population Variability**: If the variability in the population is high, detecting the true differences will be difficult; this increases β. Lower variability increases the Power of detection.\n",
    "The [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) article provides further insight into how variability affects statistical Power. \n",

Analytical approaches are discussed on the [Power of a test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) page on Wikipedia. This context points out that **Type II error (β)** is influenced not only by the difference in population means but also by methodological decisions about: **sample size, significance level, population variability**, and **test direction**."

    "\n",
    "Given this theoretical background, the subsequent simulation will be conducted to explore empirically the manner in which the **Type II error rate (β)** changes with an increased true mean difference between two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every increment of 0.1 between 0.0 and 1.0, the simulation is performed as outlined below:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Generation**  \n",
    "   Two independent samples of size 100 are drawn:  \n",
    "   - One from a standard normal distribution, *N*(0, 1)  \n",
    "   - One from a normal distribution with mean *d* and standard deviation 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repetition**  \n",
    "   This process is repeated 1,000 times for each value of *d*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Testing**  \n",
    "   - For each pair of samples, a separate independent samples *t*-test is conducted.  \n",

    "1. **Data Generation**  \n",
    "   - Two independent samples are generated using [`numpy.random.normal`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html).  \n",
    "     - The first sample is drawn from *N*(0, 1) — representing the control group.  \n",
    "     - The second sample is drawn from *N*(d, 1) — representing the treatment group with a true mean shift of *d*.  \n",
    "   - Each sample matrix has shape *(n_sims, n)*, allowing 1,000 independent experiments to be simulated at once.  \n",
    "     This vectorised approach significantly improves computational efficiency compared to looping over simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistical Testing**  \n",
    "   - The [`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) function performs independent-samples *t*-tests for all simulations in a single call.  \n",
    "   - The argument `axis=1` ensures that each row (i.e. each simulated experiment) is treated as a separate test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type II Error Calculation**  \n",
    "   - For each test, the associated *p*-value is compared to the chosen significance level (`alpha = 0.05`).  \n",
    "   - The expression `p_values >= alpha` picks out tests that **fail to reject the null hypothesis** (possible Type II errors).  \n",
    "   - Using [`numpy.mean`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html), the proportion of such cases is computed, giving the **estimated Type II error rate** for that *d* value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Storage**  \n",
    "   - Each computed β value is appended to the list `type2_errors` for later analysis and visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently quantifies how often a *t*-test fails to detect a true difference as the underlying mean separation increases.\n"

    "#### Research Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of three populations.  \n",
    "- Investigate how ANOVA performs as a global test of mean equality.  \n",
    "- Examine the results of multiple t-tests between groups and their potential pitfalls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Generation**  \n",
    "   - Each sample contains 30 observations drawn from a normal distribution.  \n",
    "   - Sample means are 0, 0.5, and 1, with a standard deviation of 1.  \n",
    "   - See [NumPy Random Normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Test (ANOVA)**  \n",
    "   - Null hypothesis: all three population means are equal.  \n",
    "   - ANOVA compares the variance between groups with the variance within groups to determine whether the observed differences among sample means are statistically significant.  \n",
    "   - Reference: [ANOVA - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **T-Tests Between Groups**  \n",
    "   - Three independent t-tests are conducted: sample 1 compared with sample 2, sample 1 compared with sample 3, and sample 2 compared with sample 3.  \n",
    "   - Each test examines whether the two corresponding population means differ significantly.  \n",
    "   - Reference: [t-test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison and Interpretation**  \n",
    "   - ANOVA provides a single global decision regarding mean equality, controlling the Type I error rate.  \n",
    "   - T-tests between groups identify which specific pairs of means differ.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- ANOVA should detect at least one significant difference if the means are truly unequal.  \n",
    "- The largest differences (sample 1 compared with sample 3) are expected to be significant in t-tests.  \n",
    "- Small differences (sample 1 compared with sample 2) may not be significant depending on sample variability.  \n",
    "- This analysis demonstrates the advantage of using a global test like ANOVA before conducting multiple comparisons.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### **ANOVA Results**\n",

    "* **Explanation:** The test confirms that **one of the group means is different** - it establishes that not all means are equal. However, ANOVA does not identify *which* groups differ. ANOVA is preferred as a preliminary test because it **looks at all groups together in a single test**.\n",

    "ANOVA, the probability of detecting such a difference through chance alone (a false-positive) increases. For example, comparing three groups by running three t-tests separately increases the chance of at least one false-positive error to about **14%**. Using ANOVA first is a **smarter way to handle comparisons** and makes the analysis **clearer and more efficient**. Follow-up tests are conducted only after a significant result is found and **often require adjustments to keep errors in check**.\n",

    "### **Why ANOVA Is Preferred Over Running Several t‑Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is preferred over running several t‑tests because performing multiple independent t‑tests greatly increases the risk of a **Type I error** (a false positive). As shown in the video [*Why is ANOVA used instead of Multiple T‑tests?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B2o9v8oP0g), each additional t‑test raises the probability of detecting a difference purely by chance. This issue is also highlighted in the Laerd Statistics guide under *[Why not compare groups with multiple t‑tests?](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/one-way-anova-statistical-guide-2.php#:~:text=Why%20not%20compare%20groups%20with%20multiple%20t%2Dtests%3F)*, which explains that repeated t‑tests inflate the overall error rate. ANOVA avoids this problem by using **one overall test** to evaluate all groups simultaneously, keeping the error rate properly controlled before any follow‑up comparisons are made."

    "1.  **Statistical Power (Problem 3):** The ability to detect a true difference rapidly **increases** as the size of the true effect grows, proving the critical dependency of Power on Effect Size. \n",
    "2.  **Error Control (Problem 4):** When comparing multiple groups, **ANOVA must be used first** as it is the only way to control the overall inflation of the **Type I Error rate** ($\\alpha$). \n",
    "3.  **Unbiased Estimation (Problem 2):** Simulations confirmed that for small samples ($n=10$), the **Sample Standard Deviation ($\\text{ddof}=1$)** is **required** to provide an unbiased estimator of the true population spread. \n",
    "4.  **Test Rigor (Problem 1):** Expanding the experimental design space (from 8 to 12 cups) significantly **decreased the $p$-value**, verifying that a more robust design naturally strengthens the test against random chance."
