In this case, the researcher assumes data come from **two independent normal distributions**, conducts **t-tests**, and records how often the test fails to reject the null hypothesis."

    "### Research and Development Context\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of **Type II errors**, the study considers several factors that influence the **statistical \n",
    "power** of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**: Increasing the sample size lowers variability, hence allowing detection of true differences by the test.\n",
    "A more complete description of this relationship can be shown on the Wikipedia page for [Statistical Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level of Significance (α):** A decrease in the level of significance α reduces the probability of Type I error but increases that of Type II. Similarly, an increased α decreases β.\n",
    "For more information, see the section entitled [Significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance#Significance_level) in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Population Variability**: If the variability in the population is high, detecting the true differences will be difficult; this increases β. Lower variability increases the Power of detection.\n",
    "The [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) article provides further insight into how variability affects statistical Power. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Directional vs. Non-directional Tests:** Where the direction of the effect is known, a one-tailed test may reduce β; where it is not, a two-tailed test provides greater generality but at some loss of sensitivity. For more information see the [One- and two-tailed tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-_and_two-tailed_tests) page on Wikipedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytical Comparison:** Comparing simulation-based estimates of β with theoretical power calculations enables a more complete assessment of the simulation's validity. Analytical approaches are discussed on the [Power of a test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) page on Wikipedia. This context points out that **Type II error (β)** is influenced not only by the difference in population means but also by methodological decisions about: **sample size, significance level, population variability**, and **test direction**."
