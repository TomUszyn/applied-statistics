    "Based on the [Detailed Explanation of Type II Error | Sapien's AI Glossary](https://www.sapien.io/glossary/definition/type-2-error), a **Type II error** occurs when a statistical test concludes in favor of the null hypothesis even though the null hypothesis is actually false. In this case, the researcher assumes data come from **two independent normal distributions**, conducts **t-tests**, and records how often the test fails to reject the null hypothesis."

    "### Research and Development Context\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of **Type II errors**, the study considers several factors that influence the **statistical \n",
    "power** of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**: Increasing the sample size lowers variability, hence allowing detection of true differences by the test.\n",
    "A more complete description of this relationship can be shown on the Wikipedia page for [Statistical Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level of Significance (α):** A decrease in the level of significance α reduces the probability of Type I error but increases that of Type II. Similarly, an increased α decreases β.\n",
    "For more information, see the section entitled [Significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance#Significance_level) in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Population Variability**: If the variability in the population is high, detecting the true differences will be difficult; this increases β. Lower variability increases the Power of detection.\n",
    "The [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) article provides further insight into how variability affects statistical Power. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Directional vs. Non-directional Tests:** Where the direction of the effect is known, a one-tailed test may reduce β; where it is not, a two-tailed test provides greater generality but at some loss of sensitivity. For more information see the [One- and two-tailed tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-_and_two-tailed_tests) page on Wikipedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytical Comparison:** Comparing simulation-based estimates of β with theoretical power calculations enables a more complete assessment of the simulation's validity. Analytical approaches are discussed on the [Power of a test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) page on Wikipedia. This context points out that **Type II error (β)** is influenced not only by the difference in population means but also by methodological decisions about: **sample size, significance level, population variability**, and **test direction**."

    "- Determine whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of three populations.  \n",
    "- Investigate how ANOVA performs as a global test of mean equality.  \n",
    "- Examine the results of multiple t-tests between groups and their potential pitfalls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Generation**  \n",
    "   - Each sample contains 30 observations drawn from a normal distribution.  \n",
    "   - Sample means are 0, 0.5, and 1, with a standard deviation of 1.  \n",
    "   - See [NumPy Random Normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Test (ANOVA)**  \n",
    "   - Null hypothesis: all three population means are equal.  \n",
    "   - ANOVA compares the variance between groups with the variance within groups to determine whether the observed differences among sample means are statistically significant.  \n",
    "   - Reference: [ANOVA - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **T-Tests Between Groups**  \n",
    "   - Three independent t-tests are conducted: sample 1 compared with sample 2, sample 1 compared with sample 3, and sample 2 compared with sample 3.  \n",
    "   - Each test examines whether the two corresponding population means differ significantly.  \n",
    "   - Reference: [t-test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison and Interpretation**  \n",
    "   - ANOVA provides a single global decision regarding mean equality, controlling the Type I error rate.  \n",
    "   - T-tests between groups identify which specific pairs of means differ.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- ANOVA should detect at least one significant difference if the means are truly unequal.  \n",
    "- The largest differences (sample 1 compared with sample 3) are expected to be significant in t-tests.  \n",
    "- Small differences (sample 1 compared with sample 2) may not be significant depending on sample variability.  \n",
